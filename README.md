# **Kim Sagha**


Hi there, and welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kim and I'm a 22 year old girl from Sweden. After graduating from high school in Stockholm in 2017, where I specialised in mathematics, I decided to join Schneider Electric for an internship which later led to a full-time programming role. Working there introduced me to the incredible world of IoT and energy, and taught me how to work in a team of programmers as well as with non-technical clients. After building excitingly smart and efficient building management systems for a year, I decided to move on to expand my skillset even more.

In 2018, I made the awesome life-changing decision of moving to Nottingham, UK to study Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Nottingham where I was the team leader of a year-long project with Capital One and the president of the Computer Science Society CompSoc, aside from learning really cool AI and ML algorithms. Since graduating with my Bachelors degree in August of 2021, I've spent a majority of my time researching new technologies in my main areas of interest and implementing these new skills in projects as demonstrated here on GitHub. Feel free to check them out, fork them and add new features, or contact me to discuss them further!

# **Kim Sagha**


Hi there, and welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

My name is Kim and I'm a 22 year old girl from Sweden. I started my tech-journey in 2017 at Schneider Electric, in the incredible world of IoT and energy, building excitingly smart and efficient building management systems. In 2018, I made the awesome life-changing decision of moving to Nottingham, UK to study Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Nottingham, where I learned how to program and build AI models. Since graduating, I've spent a majority of my time researching new technologies in data science, predominantly focusing on fields within ML such as supervised models, NLP and deep learning, and implementing these new skills in projects as demonstrated here on GitHub. Feel free to check them out, fork them and add new features, or contact me to discuss them further!
